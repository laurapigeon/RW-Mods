Turn Storage Marker
by pinecubes (laura#2871)

ctrl+f6 -> toggles permanent turn storage mode 
		   (as long as you press in a direction, you have turn storage in that direction)
		   
ctrl+f7 -> toggles store or die mode
		   (slugcat starts with turn storage and if they lose it they die instantly :D)
